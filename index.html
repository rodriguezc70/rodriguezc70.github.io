<p style="font: bold 30px cursive;color:white;text-align:center;">Hello to everyone reading this! My name is Christopher Rodriguez. I am a junior in Montclair State University (MSU). I am a tall, friendly, and funny man you can come across. Iâ€™m a transfer to MSU, originally coming from County College of Morris (CCM) so the campus is a new experience to me.

For now though, I continue working my part time job at Costco while I attend college. As it can be hinted at, I do like video games and enjoy playing them in my offtime.
